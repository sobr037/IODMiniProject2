        <h1>Understanding Carbon Offset and Carbon Capture</h1>

        <h2>Carbon Offset</h2>
        <p>Carbon offsetting is a way to compensate for your carbon emissions that you're unable to reduce by supporting projects that reduce or capture an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases. These projects can include reforestation, renewable energy, and energy efficiency initiatives. By purchasing carbon offsets, individuals can take responsibility for their emissions and contribute to climate change mitigation.</p>

        <h2>Offset Your Carbon Emissions</h2>
        <p>Consider supporting these initiatives to offset your carbon emissions:</p>

        </ul>

        <h2>Carbon Capture</h2>
        <p>Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a technology aimed at capturing carbon dioxide emissions from industrial processes or power generation and storing them underground to prevent their release into the atmosphere. In New Zealand, CCS is not a primary focus due to the country's relatively low CO2 emissions from point sources and a high contribution of renewable energy to electricity generation.</p>

        <p>New Zealand supports international efforts to develop CCS, especially in countries with significant CO2 emissions. This support does not imply a commitment to implementing CCS domestically, but recognizes the importance of CCS in achieving global climate goals by removing CO2 from the atmosphere. We expect the commecialisation of Carbon Capture credits to accelerate moving forward and this will become another avenue to remove the quivalent of your carbon footprint from the atmosphere.</p>
